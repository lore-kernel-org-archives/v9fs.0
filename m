I don't think delaying put_super() or freeing the superblock helps.
That's not where the issue is. The issue is with sb->s_fs_info being
available after a grace period and that can go away in different
locations ->put_super() or ->kill_sb(). Bringing put_super() into the
argument was maybe not my best idea. We also need to backport this
stuff.
