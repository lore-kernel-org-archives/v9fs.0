Thank you for the legwork!

Given how surprised I found this I could imagine other virtio users to
incorrectly assume the same, so I think it's worth bringing up even if
it doesn't end up implemented (we could actually probably cap this on
the 9p side if we wanted to anyway)

I think truncating rc.size is worth the effort even if most of the paths
are correct, and more appropriate than this current patch, so let's drop
this patch - thank you nevertheless Yizhou Zhao for starting the
discussion.
I'm out of steam though so will take some time to send the
virtualization list a mail.. :)

Hm, yeah, I was confused and considered this as a oob write but it's the
"reading a page that doesn't exist" that fails, so it's not likely to be
too bad even if it does happen.

I'm not sure why I didn't reply to that thread back then, but it's been
picked up in 7.2 :)
