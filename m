I don't mind either way -- I think 20 days for such a timeout is enough,
but I agree being able to set something like '60s' or '100ms' would
certainly be convenient.

I'm actually surprised there's no such parsing helper in the kernel?!
The only related code I could find was parse_ns_duration /
parse_seconds_duration in tools/tracing/rtla/src/utils.c but that's for
tools, and there doesn't seem to be anything we could use..

Well, it's not that bad, so I'm not fussy here.

I'd slightly favor negtimeout over ndtimeout but am fine with either
here.
('nd' sounds like something network-y to me, network discovery or ndo,
but that's not a hard no)
