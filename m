Sorry for dropping the ball here, I haven't had any time to do 9p stuff
at all recently and the wave of LLM generated patches hasn't helped...

Right, that was my question; I honestly just don't understand the
requirement/promises of the netfs layer.

In this particular case we have two patterns to address:
- synthetic files with stat size > actual size,
e.g. /sys/devices/system/cpu/online
- synthetic files with stat size = 0 (rarer),
e.g. /sys/devices/virtual/net/br0/brforward

For two at least two modes:
- cache=none
- cache=loose (writeback I guess)

Right now, none of these work, with various degrees of not working;
I'm not sure we can do much about some of them (e.g. stat size=0 with
cache enabled I'm fine getting empty data), but imo
- cache=none should just try reading as userspace request anyway and
stop as soon as the server returns 0, that's not a 9p specific behavior
and I wouldn't have expected having to do any special handling for it.
(but if you tell me it's to be done in 9p case, then sure, we'll do it
here)
- cache=writeback + stat size > read size should also stop when the
server returns 0 and truncate its view of the size to that; the problem
in 9p is that we'll reset the size again to the remote size shortly
afterwards so that will need more thinking (and overlaps with the other
cache size bugs we have in flight), so let's focus on cache=none for now

Thanks,
