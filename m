Right, David sent a patch in [1], but that patch is much too complicated
(should be split/sent as proper patches/now I've actually started
looking no longer applies) and I haven't had time to look at it much
(... OTOH given the patch he sent just now I believe it would also have
fixed this new regression as well, so we might just as well have been
better served picking that up...)

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/r/1667424.1771432276@warthog.procyon.org.uk


More importantly this new regression is much bigger and should have been
caught somewhere, but I ran my "9p-for-7.2-rc1" tests on top of 7.0 and
not on top of the merged state as of 7.1 so I didn't hit it (that's easy
enough to fix going forward), and I haven't had any time to look at 9p
stuff since then (... despite the dozen of patches sent during the 7.3
cycle that I didn't get to look at either...);
I can't fault anyone else but myself at this point but the 9p client
really is in a poor shape right now :/


Anyway, getting back on topic instead of lamenting: things can't be
worse with David's patch so I'll try to find time to pick it up/run
quick checks/send to Linus over the weekend, thank you both.


Long term I'd like to say I want to spend some time sorting out the
older patch better but I'm afraid I'm going to need help...
