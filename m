So I prototyped your thing and all version I could see working end up
penalizing umount and filesystem shutdown quite heavily. Maybe I'm not
imagnative enough but everything involving synchronize_rcu* should be
kicked in the n*ts. Because if you're going onto big machines your
workloads will get said kick.
