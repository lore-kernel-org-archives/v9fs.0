Gentle reminder that this apparently made no progress for a week now. Or
was there progress and I just missed it? Then apologies in advance.

I'm asking, as it afaics would be nice to have this resolved in mainline
before the next -rc. That would be ideal to avoid last minute changes
after the last rc.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
