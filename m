If procfs job isn't to provide problematic files to userspace I'm not
sure what it is. Joking aside, I think in general you are of course
right that procfs is full of files that under a very strict
interpretation of "regular file" should absolutely not count as a
regular file. sysfs probably as well and let's ignore debugfs and
tracefs and all the other magic filesystems or files.

In general, Linux has been so loosey-goosey with "regular file" for such
a long-time that making OPENAT2_REGULAR come up with some strict
definition of "this is a regular file - no really, pinky-promise a
regular one" - is just doomed to fail.

The other problem is that we cannot reasonably determine what odd file
the user really wanted to defend against opening with OPENAT2_REGULAR.
A caller may really want to open /proc/kmsg and just be sure that
someone didn't overmount it with a fifo (systemd does that in containers
iirc).

My personal "hot take" is that adding an api built around a regular file
with immediate irreversible side-effects for the caller on VFS
syscall-based open [1] is a bug. Such broken semantics is what ioctl()s
are for.

[1]: I mean specifically open(), openat2() etc. I'm excluding all
     dedicated APIs that return file descriptors that cannot be reopened
     via regular lookup.

From my pov, what would help is if one had a flexible way to scope opens
on e.g., filesystem. But imo, that is not policy the kernel can
reasonably express at the syscall api layer - it would look fugly as
hell and how many other knobs would we have to add to satisfy all needs.
I think that is best left to an lsm hooking into security_file_open()
which can maintain a map of files and filesystems to allow or deny - a
bpf lsm can do this quite nicely.
