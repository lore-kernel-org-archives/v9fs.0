st_gen comes from FS_IOC_GETVERSION which is exactly i_generation on at
least ext4/btrfs/xfs, so it's not like that brings you anything
(and it's also stored in the 9p inode's i_generation afaics?)

My understanding is that if the underlying filesystem supports it then
yes mountpoint + i_ino + i_generation ought to be unique when combined
together, but that leaves you with what to do with filesystems that
don't support it (at least tmpfs?) and 9p mounts sharing multiple
filesystems (even if qemu has been warning about it for a while and that
brings its own share of bugs around cache)

If you're fine not supporting them, I think that definitely looks more
promising, but otherwise you don't have much choice


Either way I'm afraid I don't have time to look much into it (I'm afraid
I have to admit I didn't read your full mail, and I have to get up in 4
hours so I should probably stop processing this 9p backlog...), and it
doesn't look like Greg is much more reactive, so you're on your own and
I'm really sorry about it :/
I wish you best though!

(inotify/fanotify would need a protocol overhaul to get "right" and is a
much bigger can of works, because if you get it to work locally then
you'll get people to expect the server to notify clients of remote
changes (some network filesystems can do it with leases, but 9p doesn't
have any such mechanism);
I can understand it is useful even if it only works within the client
local changes but I'm not sure I want to push much here either.)
