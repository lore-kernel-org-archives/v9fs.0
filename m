I think that'll be fine; plain write() syscall works like this when an
error happens after some data has been flushed, and I assume there'll be
some retry if this happpened on something like a flush dirty and it got
a partial write reported?

Might be useful to track down if this came frm a file without private
data or lookup failing, but given this was a bug I guess we can deal
with that when that happens -- ack.

Thanks for clarifying

Historically this check was more about finding a fid that wasn't opened
properly than the VFS doing something weird (e.g. by calling mprotect
after mmap and us missing that -- would need to check if that works
actually...)

If we're the only user I guess we shouldn't bother with it at this
point, we can come back to it if this ever becomes common.
