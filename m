And one thing I forgot to say: that requirement exists today. It is
entirely accidental that this wasn't an issue in the umount() path
because of the synchronize_rcu* in there. But said grace period doesn't
exist if you e.g., chdir() out of a mount and put the last reference
while still in lookup. Then said filesystems are fscked today because
that is a requirement. And various reproducers in this series illustrate
that.
