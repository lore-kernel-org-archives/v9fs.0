Right, generally speaking I agree things should work as long as the
mount is exclusive (can't change server side/no other client); but
I think it's fine to extend this to server being "sane" (as in,
protocol-wise we're supposed to be guaranteed that two files are
identical if and only if qid is identical)

This makes sense, let's stick to loose/metadata for this as well.

I think it's better to keep things simple first and check the actual
impact with a couple of simple benchmarks (re-opening a file in a loop
with cache=none should hit this path?)

If we want to improve this, rather than keeping the full string it might
make sense to carry a partial hash in each dentry so we can get away
with checking only the parent's dentry + current dentry, or something
like that?
But, simple and working is better than fast and broken, so let's have a
simple v1 first.

Yeah, I also do this manually with entr[1], and git's fsmonitor (with
watchman) does that too -- so I guess people living in a 9p mount would
see it..

But I think 9p is just slow in general so such setups can probably be
improved more drastically by using something else :P

Anyway, thank you for your time/work, I'll try to be more timely in
later reviews.
