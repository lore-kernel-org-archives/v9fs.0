Christian had a mail that a previous version was applied, but I think
this is a bad idea.  This is a giant series that also touches core code
with no review whatsoever.  And I repeatedly asked for:

 1) the core changes to be split out
 2) come up with users for this very core primitive in the hot path
    (iov_iter) that are not just for your rather niche use case

There's been absolutely no follow on to this, and we should not treat
the absolute core I/O path like this.

> ver #6)
> - Rebased on v7.2-rc3.
> - Added a patch to remove erofs on-demand support from cachefiles.
> - Added a patch to remove the writethrough code as it's really tricky to
>   get the locking right and it looks like can deadlock itself with Ceph.
> - Fixed a number of bugs reported by Sashiko[4].
>   - Fixed iov_iter_single_seg_count(), iov_iter_alignment_bvecq() and
>     iov_npages_bvecq() to handle zero-length segments and segments with no
>     stuff remaining.
>   - Fixed bvecq_extract() to use GFP_NOFS rather than GFP_KERNEL.
>   - Fixed bvecq_alloc_buffer2()'s use of alloc_pages_bulk().
>   - Fixed netfs_extract_iter() to break out of the inner loop if max_pages
>     hits zero.
>   - Added a patch to fix meta block mapping in afs_edit_dir_remove().
>   - Fixed afs_init_new_symlink() to clear the tail of the symlink page.
>   - Fixed cachefiles_begin_operation() to deal with a NULL file.
>   - Fixed slot check in netfs_read_gaps() to be >=, not >.
>   - Fixed netfs_pgpriv2_copy_folio() to update creq->last_end.
>   - Fixed netfs_read_single() to return -EIO if the buffer isn't big
>     enough.
>   - Add a comment to netfs_write_folio() to indicate that truncate must
>     not run concurrently with writeback and must exclude/wait for it.
>   - In netfs_read_subreq_terminated(), move the netfs_sreq_trace_too_much
>     trace line earlier before ->transferred is clobbered.
>   - In netfs_read_subreq_terminated(), make the transfer-too-long case
>     avoid retrying and just end with EIO (in case data further along in the
>     buffer got corrupted).
>   - Fixed netfs_collect_read_results() if it sees front->transferred >
>     front->len, to just use front->len instead.
>   - Fixed ceph_netfs_issue_op_inline() to prep the buffer before setting
>     NETFS_SREQ_HIT_EOF so that subreq->content is set.
>   - Alter netfs_read_to_pagecache() to not round up reading from
>     zero-containing cache granules as no I/O is required.
>   - Made ->issue_write() return an error so that errors before any buffer
>     is sliced off don't result in an infinite loop in netfs_issue_writes().
>   - Made ->issue_read() return an error also for similiar reasons.
>   - In netfs_writepages(), handle -ENOMEM from bvecq prealloc before
>     caling netfs_queue_wb_folio() rather than doing it on the combined
>     error return of that and netfs_issue_streams() which can result in a
>     double unlock.
>   - Fix netfs_writeback_single() to write nothing if len == 0.
> 
> ver #5)
> - Rebased on v7.2-rc2 as that has a bunch of outstanding netfs and afs
>   bugfixes included.
> 
> ver #4)
> - Fixed a number of bugs reported by Sashiko[3].
>   - Added a patch to fix an underflow in iov_iter_extract_xarray_pages().
>   - Added a patch to fix alloc failure in iov_iter_extract_bvec_pages().
>   - Added a patch to remove an unused var in kunit code.
>   - Added a patch to fix the folio offset in extract_xarray_to_sg().
>   - Added a patch to fix the exclusion over writeback to make it cover
>     collection too.
>   - Fixed double fput() in cachefiles.
>   - Fixed the collection of cache writes to handle cancellation better.
>   - Fixed iterate_bvecq() to skip bvecq structs with nr_slots==0.
>   - Add a comment into iterate_bvecq() that a slot with bv_len>0 must have a
>     valid bv_page.
>   - Fixed iov_iter_bvecq_advance(), iov_iter_bvecq_revert(),
>     iter_count_bvecq_pages(), iov_iter_extract_bvecq_pages() and
>     extract_bvecq_to_sg() to correctly handle empty bvecqs.
>   - Fixed extract_bvecq_to_sg() to be limited by iter->count.
>   - Fixed bvecq_expand_buffer() to take an unsigned size param.
>   - Fixed bvecq_expand_buffer() to not mix memory types in alloc'd bvecqs.
>   - Fixed bvecq_shorten_buffer() occasional retention of zero-length slots.
>   - Fixed slot validity check polarity in bvecq_pos_advance(); also don't use
>     inner loop otherwise break then exits the wrong loop.
>   - Fixed bvecq_zero(), bvecq_slice() and bvecq_extract to use a barrier when
>     checking bq->nr_slots.
>   - Restructured bvecq_zero() to be similar to bvecq_pos_advance().
>   - Fixed an off-by-one error in bvecq_pos_step() and added a missing slot
>     reset.
>   - Fixed a break in netfs_extract_iter() that should have been a goto.
>   - Fixed netfs_extract_iter() to limit number of pages extracted to remnant
>     of max_pages.
>   - Fixed an uninit var in afs_do_read_symlink().
>   - Fixed netfs_read_gaps() to fill a multipart bvecq chain correctly.
>   - Fixed netfs_dispatch_unbuffered_reads() to initialise collect_cursor as
>     netfs_rreq_assess_dio() uses it to flush the data read.
>   - Fixed netfs_extract_iter() to init the slot counter outside the extract
>     loop to avoid overwriting already loaded slots.
>   - Fixed callers of bvecq_delete_spent() to update bvecq_pos::slot before
>     calling.
>   - Fixed netfs_reissue_write() to make sure subreq->content is unset before
>     setting.
>   - Altered netfs_extract_iter() to free any allocated bvecq chain if no pages
>     were extracted and an error occurred  (and to initialise the return
>     pointer to NULL).  Also, made it return an empty bvecq if nothing was
>     extracted, but no error occurred.
>   - Fixed ceph_netfs_issue_read() to just return if
>     ceph_netfs_issue_op_inline() returns anything other than 1 to avoid a
>     double termination.
>   - Fixed ceph_netfs_issue_read() to do the size calculation in the right
>     order to avoid the op expanding to larger than the buffer.
>   - Fixed netfs_issue_read(), in the NETFS_FILL_WITH_ZEROES case, to deduct
>     subreq->len from stream->buffered rather than just setting it to 0.
>   - Fixed netfs_perform_write() to put the folio if netfs_advance_writethrough()
>     fails.
>   - Restored the old ->prepare_write op specifically for
>     fscache_write_to_cache() which is still used by Ceph.
>   - Fixed undefined return in netfs_pgpriv2_issue_stream().
>   - Fixed netfs_collect_write_results() to try to make sure a request isn't
>     left paused if there are no further server-bound subreqs.
>   - Fixed netfs_queue_wb_folio() to redirty the folio before unlocking it if
>     it can't allocate a bvecq.
>   - Fixed netfs_writepages() to cancel the pagecache iteration after ENOMEM.
>   - Fixed netfs_advance/end_writethrough() to advance the dispatch cursor.
>   - Fixed netfs_retry_read_subrequests() to use barriers when walking
>     stream->subrequests as the app may add another subreq before pausing.
>   - Fixed netfs_prepare_write_retry_buffer() to use ->retry_start and
>     ->retry_buffered rather than ->issue_from and ->buffered.
>   - Fixed netfs_retry_write_stream() to use barriers when walking
>     stream->subrequests as the app may add another subreq before pausing.
>   - Fixed netfs_retry_write_stream() to check the correct length when adding
>     additional subreqs.
>   - Fixed nfs_netfs_issue_read() to set -ENOMEM, not 0, on alloc failure.
>   - Fixed nfs_netfs_issue_read() to only terminate the subreq once.
>   - Fixed cifs_issue_read() to release the credits if cifs_reopen_file()
>     fails.
> - Rebased on v7.1.
> 
> ver #3)
> - Rebased to -rc7 as the patches wouldn't apply for Christian.
> - Prepended a fix for a warning from generic/464 (the problem also exists
>   upstream, just not the warning).
> - Renamed kmap_local_bvec() to bvec_kmap_partial() as requested by
>   Christoph.
> - Adjusted smbdirect patch descriptions as requested by Stefan Metzmacher.
> 
> ver #2)
> - Fixed a number of bugs reported by Sashiko[1].
> - Split a bunch of fixes out and posted them separately[2].
