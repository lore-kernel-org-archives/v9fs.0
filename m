(gah, I hate emails when one gets added to thread later.. I've just now
opened the thread on lore and seen David's test :/)

Aah, that's the bit I didn't get, thank you!

Yes, this totally makes sense; I agree with your analysis.

So basically 9p was optimizing for this impossible (on a normal server)
behaviour in the 9p side (it doesn't make any sense for the tx pipe to
be full with 0 in flight request, and tx pipe never goes unfull, and
reply comes (was there) before the actual write happened!!), but this
old behaviour made it work anyway...
So part of me wants to just leave it there and if anything try to make
this kind of usage impossible by adding more checks to mount -o
trans=fd, but I don't think it's possible to lock down all kind of weird
behaviour root users (=syzbot) can engage in...
OTOH syzbot does find some useful bugs so I guess it might be worth
fixing, I don't know.
If David's patch also happens to fix it I guess we can also just wait
for that?

Thanks,
