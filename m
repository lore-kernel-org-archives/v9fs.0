It got merged in yesterday


With that said I'm also curious if that's the reason 9p reads stopped
progressing, but even with this patch I think there'd be a window for
files to shrink while the read is happening so netfs needs to return a
short read anyway -- if the file really is being modified under us it's
possible to hit end of file early.

OTOH I don't think that's what's happening here though, as Kent is
likely just running xfstest on its own in a directory...
You says these errors just started happening recently?
How recently are you talking?
I doubt it's been months but the only recent changes I see in this area
would be the netfs i_size updating patches early July.. If it's more
recent than that there's something else I didn't see anything obvious,
having a rough range to look at would be welcome for closer inspection.
