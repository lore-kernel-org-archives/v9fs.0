net/9p/trans_virtio.c:

static void req_done(struct virtqueue *vq)
{
    ...
    unsigned int len;
    struct p9_req_t *req;
    ...
    while ((req = virtqueue_get_buf(chan->vq, &len)) != NULL) {
    ...
        if (len) {
	req->rc.size = len;
	p9_client_cb(chan->client, req, REQ_STATUS_RCVD);
        }
        ...
    }
    ...
}

drivers/virtio/virtio_ring.c:

virtqueue_get_buf() ->
    virtqueue_get_buf_ctx() ->
        VIRTQUEUE_CALL() ->
            // for "split" ring type :
            virtqueue_get_buf_ctx_split(
                vring_virtqueue *vq,
                unsigned int *len,
                void **ctx)
            {
                ...
                *len = vring_read_split_used_len(vq, last_used);
                ...
            }

static inline u32 vring_read_split_used_len(const struct vring_virtqueue *vq,
                                            u16 idx)
{
    return virtio32_to_cpu(vq->vq.vdev,
                           READ_ONCE(vq->split.vring.used->ring[idx].len));
}

And `len` field is just shared DMA memory written by server. The len value is 
not questioned anywhere in the call stack, it is taken as-is.

This is for "split" ring type which QEMU's 9p virtio device is always using 
(as QEMU's virtio device is not advertising "packed" ring type). Linux 9p 
client is agnostic about the two, but it does not matter either way, because 
even with "packed" ring type the call stack would be slightly different, the 
len field would be 32-bit instead of 16-bit, but its value was still not 
questioned anywhere.

Surprisingly though, it is not as bad as one might think first. OOB should be 
limited to the page walk in handle_rerror() - this patch; and to pdu parse for 
the 9p2000.u error string (i.e. Twrite ZC -> handle_rerror() returns early on
!pages -> p9_check_errors() then OOB there at:

  ...
  p9pdu_readf(&req->rc, c->proto_version, "s?d", &ename, &ecode);
  ...

All others should be fine actually, since:

- Non zero-copy 9p request types are safe (checked against capacity), so it 
boils down to Tread/Treaddir/Twrite request types responses as only possible 
cases:

- Tread/Treaddir/Twrite returning *non-error* response (and server lying about 
len): all count validated by client already -> safe.

- So it is really just 9p2000.u Rerror returned for either Tread/Treaddir/
Twrite: Tread and Treaddir handled by patch -> then safe, Twrite as outlined 
above being the only open candidate left and that could (additional to this 
patch) be easily fixed by just moving the P9_ZC_HDR_SZ clamp before the return 
on !pages in handle_rerror() happens.

Or:

You could simply pass the bad card on to the virtio subsystem maintainers, and 
tell them to clamp used-ring element's `len` field against the guest provided 
descriptor length, then req->rc.size would be trusted - no validation to be 
done on 9p side. But even then I can imagine that this would be implemented by 
virtio maintainers as an opt-in solution for drivers like "please clamp this 
for me" to avoid breaking certain legacy devices.

"Confidential Guest Support" is the term. Wouldn't change the picture here 
though, as this is about a host triggered DoS. Host could still kill the guest 
at any time.

The negative dentries patches come to my mind which you might have forgotten; 
I think v7 is the latest one on these:
